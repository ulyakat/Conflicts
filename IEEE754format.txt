Lecture
Twenty years ago anarchy threatened floating-point arithmetic. Over a dozen commercially significant arithmetics 
boasted diverse wordsizes, precisions, rounding procedures and over/underflow behaviors, and more were in the
works. “Portable” software intended to reconcile that numerical diversity had become unbearably costly to
develop.
Thirteen years ago, when IEEE 754 became official, major microprocessor manufacturers had already adopted it 
despite the challenge it posed to implementors. With unprecedented altruism, hardware designers had risen to its
succeed to a considerable extent. Anyway, rounding anomalies that preoccupied all of us in the 1970s afflict only 
CRAY X-MPs — J90s now.
Now atrophy threatens features of IEEE 754 caught in a vicious circle:
Those features lack support in programming languages and compilers,
so those features are mishandled and/or practically unusable,
To help break that circle,  those features are discussed in these notes under the following headings:
Representable Numbers, Normal and Subnormal, Infinite and NaN 2
Multiply-Accumulate, a Mixed Blessing 5
Exceptions in General; Retrospective Diagnostics 6
supersedes one distributed at a panel discussion of “Floating-Point Past, Present and Future” in a series of San
K+1 Exponent bits: 1 - 2K < k < 2K . N Significant bits: -2N < n < 2N
Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
I don't much care where â€“
Then it doesn't matter which way you go.
